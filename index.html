        <h2>What is kijakazi</h2>
            
         <p>Kijakazi is an application that helps employers find domestic workes and care takers to help them run things at their homes or work place.
                We strive to bring professionalism to an industry filled with misconceptions and exploitation, and to a large part, we are getting where we want to be. We have developed a reputation, not only in Nairobi where we began, but all over the country, that is synonymous with quality service, superior advice, and of course, staff of the highest calibre. We operate all over Kenya,from Nairobi,Kisumu Mombasa and ALL other -cities.
                We link employer to companies that recruit qualified domestic workers and the employers choice to chose if they can <em>re-interview</em> the worker once again for the doubting thomases.

        <h2>About Kijakazi</h2>
            <p>First you must understand that nobody is perfect. Every domestic worker is a human being, with strong points and failings. It is important not to be a perfectionist, just as it is important not to be too lax with your expectations, thus letting your home fall into disarray. Some things might appear obvious to you, but through experience many have learned to state the obvious, even though it may appear to be common sense. Many househelps complain of a lack of clear direction and feedback. So for the working relationship to succeed, some employers may literally have to spell out a lot of things, since each household is different. Marjorie says. "If you donâ€™t train her to assume the role you require of her, you will find yourself getting irritated a lot."</p>
            <p>Part of getting a good househelp, is giving this individual the respect she deserves, that merits her being entrusted with your most precious possessions. So at the interview stage, it is up to you to select an individual you feel you can respect and trust.</p>
